## Introduction

There are many techniques used to compress digital data (that is, to represent it using less memory). This assignment covers Huffman Coding, which is used everywhere from zipping a folder to jpeg and mp3 encodings. I implement both decompression (a.k.a. uncompressing) and compression using Huffman Coding.
